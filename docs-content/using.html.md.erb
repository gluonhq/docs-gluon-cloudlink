This topic describes how to use Gluon CloudLink Service Broker for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

##<a id='using'></a> Using Gluon CloudLink Service Broker

Each Gluon CloudLink subscription of the Gluon account that was used when configuring Gluon CloudLink Service Broker
comes with a single Gluon CloudLink Application. A Plan is created for each Gluon CloudLink Application and made
available in the Gluon CloudLink Service in the Apps Manager Marketplace. Create a Service Instance and bind it to any
application to get access to the credentials of the Gluon CloudLink Application.

#### Apps Manager Marketplace

In Apps Manager, navigate to the Marketplace and select the Gluon CloudLink Service. Each Gluon CloudLink Application
is listed as a Plan that can be used to create a Service Instance.

Once a Service Instance is bound to an application, the Gluon CloudLink Application credentials will be available from
the application's environment variables.

#### cf CLI

Perform the following steps to access the credentials of a Gluon CloudLink Application:

1. Get a list of the individual plans for the `gluon-cloudlink-service-broker` Service from the Marketplace. Each plan
   represents an active subscription for a Gluon CloudLink Application.

	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf marketplace -s gluon-cloudlink-service-broker
	Getting service plan information for service gluon-cloudlink-service-broker as admin...
	OK

	service plan                  description                                                          free or paid
	Gluon CloudLink Application   Gluon CloudLink Application - 45XXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX   free
	</pre>

1. Create a Service Instance for one of the available Plans and bind it to an application.

	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf create-service gluon-cloudlink-service-broker "Gluon CloudLink Application" "Gluon CloudLink App"

	$ cf bind-service hello-world "Gluon CloudLink App"
	</pre>

1. Use the `cf env` command to display the credentials of the bound Gluon CloudLink Application:

	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf env hello-world

	Getting env variables for app hello-world in org Gluon / space My Space as admin...
	OK

	System-Provided:
	{
	 "VCAP_SERVICES": {
	  "gluon-cloudlink-service-broker": [
	   {
	    "credentials": {
	     "clientKey": "45XXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX",
	     "clientSecret": "3eXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX",
	     "hostname": "https://cloud.gluonhq.com",
	     "serverKey": "MHwwDQ..."
	    },
	    "label": "gluon-cloudlink-service-broker",
	    "name": "Gluon CloudLink App",
	    "plan": "Gluon CloudLink Application",
	...
	</pre>
